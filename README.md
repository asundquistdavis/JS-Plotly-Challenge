# JS-Plotly-Challenge
## Overview
This challenge creates an interactive dashboard to explore a bellybutton diversity dataset. The dashboard uses Plotly JS to render the graphics for 153 different samples. The data is obtained from an api call using the d3 script. The website is hosted [here](https://asundquistdavis.github.io/JS-Plotly-Challenge/).
